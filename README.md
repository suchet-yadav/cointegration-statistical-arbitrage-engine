# Cointegration-Based Statistical Arbitrage Engine

A quantitative trading system that identifies market-neutral opportunities using cointegration and mean-reversion dynamics, with a full pipeline for signal generation, portfolio construction, and backtesting.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project implements a **statistical arbitrage (StatArb) strategy** based on **cointegration-driven pairs trading**, designed to exploit temporary mispricings between related financial instruments.

Statistical arbitrage strategies rely on **mean-reversion signals** derived from statistical relationships between assets.  
Cointegration ensures that selected asset pairs maintain a **long-term equilibrium relationship**, even if they diverge in the short term.

The system identifies such deviations and generates trading signals assuming the spread will revert to its mean.

## 🧠 Strategy Intuition

Cointegrated assets share a long-term equilibrium relationship.  
Short-term deviations from this equilibrium create mean-reverting opportunities.

The strategy exploits these deviations by taking opposing positions in the pair, expecting the spread to revert.

## 📐 Mathematical Formulation

Let X_t and Y_t be two cointegrated assets.

Spread:
S_t = X_t - βY_t

Z-score:
Z_t = (S_t - μ) / σ

Trading Rules:
- Enter long spread if Z_t < -threshold  
- Enter short spread if Z_t > threshold  
- Exit when Z_t approaches 0

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a modular pipeline:
Data Ingestion → Pair Selection → Cointegration Testing → Spread Modeling
→ Signal Generation → Portfolio Construction → Backtesting → Performance Metrics

## 🔬 Statistical Validation

- Cointegration is tested using the Engle-Granger method  
- Stationarity of residuals is validated using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test  
- Only statistically significant pairs are selected for trading

## 🔄 Strategy Workflow

1. **Pair Selection**
   - Identify candidate assets with potential co-movement  

2. **Cointegration Testing**
   - Validate long-term equilibrium relationship  

3. **Spread Construction**
   - Compute residual spread using regression  

4. **Signal Generation**
   - Enter trades when spread deviates beyond threshold  
   - Exit when spread reverts to mean  

5. **Backtesting**
   - Simulate trades over historical data  
   - Evaluate performance metrics  

👉 Core idea:
> Temporary deviations in cointegrated pairs create arbitrage opportunities.
